## Recommendations for Energy Reduction

1. **Optimize Operating Hours**: Schedule energy-intensive operations during periods of lower energy costs or demand.

2. **Zone-Based Temperature Control**: Implement more granular temperature control in critical zones identified by the model.

3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Use the model to detect abnormal energy consumption patterns that might indicate equipment issues.

4. **HVAC Optimization**: Adjust HVAC settings based on the identified relationship between temperature, humidity, and energy consumption.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement a real-time monitoring system using this predictive model to track energy usage and identify savings opportunities.

## Model Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Seasonal Variations**: The model may need retraining to account for seasonal changes not captured in the current dataset.

2. **Additional Features**: Consider incorporating production volume data, equipment maintenance schedules, and other operational metrics to improve predictions.

3. **Ensemble Approach**: For production deployment, consider an ensemble of models to improve robustness and accuracy.
